# How to run

One can reproduce the simulation results in our paper that is under review and will appear soon by running:

Stabilization case: `sim_reply_stab.m`

H infinity control case: `sim_reply_Hinf.m`

Data of System matrices can be found in `A_matrices_{stab,Hinf}.m` and  `B_matrices_{stab,Hinf}.m`.
